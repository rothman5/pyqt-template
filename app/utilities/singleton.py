        Create or return the singleton instance of the class.
        If the instance does not exist, it is created; otherwise, the existing instance is returned.
        A thread lock is used to ensure thread safety when creating the instance.
        Check-lock-check pattern is used to avoid unnecessary locking after the instance is created.
        We accept that the first call to __call__ may be slow due to the lock acquisition,
        but subsequent calls will be fast as they return the already created instance without locking.

        Args:
            cls (type[T]): The class to create or return the instance of.
            *args: Positional arguments to pass to the class constructor.
            **kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the class constructor.

        Returns:
            T: The singleton instance of the class.
        Raises:
            TypeError: If the class does not support instantiation with the provided arguments.
